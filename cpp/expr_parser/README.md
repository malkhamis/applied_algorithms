This is a simple algebraic expression parser to demonstrate how stack, binary trees and their traversal, and recursion are used to build and evaluate an abstract syntax tree (AST).

Some highlights of the design:
* using inheritance, virtual functions & destructors, and polymorphism.
* implementing of the factory design pattern to ease defining new operations.
* utilizing lambda expression to make what looks like nested functions.
* ensuring that the recursive calling of the lambda expression is exception safe by using smart pointers.
* using keyword 'auto' to reduce verbosity if possible.
